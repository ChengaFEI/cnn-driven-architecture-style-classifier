## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.jpg)

This project introduces a novel architecture style classification model aimed at discerning various architectural styles based on their visual characteristics. As individuals explore new environments, encountering buildings of historical or unique significance often sparks curiosity about their architectural styles and the narratives they encapsulate. However, recognizing and cataloging diverse architectural styles can be challenging for humans due to their sheer abundance and complexity. In response to this challenge, our study proposes the development of an architecture style classification model capable of real-time recognition. This model holds promising applications, particularly for tourists who can capture images of buildings and promptly identify their architectural styles. The primary objective is to create a system adept at recognizing architectural styles across different historical eras and various architects' designs. By employing advanced visual recognition techniques, our model aims to contribute to the seamless integration of technology into architectural appreciation, providing an accessible tool for enthusiasts, historians, and tourists alike. The potential impact of such a model extends beyond individual curiosity, offering a practical solution for instant architectural style identification in diverse scenarios.

## Built With

- `Python`
- `PyTorch`

## Getting Started

- Augumented Dataset

  - You can download the dataset from the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yt9CG-i1Ktt5NevSWfNTlQtQDt8PPyJR/view?usp=drive_link)
  - Unzip the file and rename the folder to `data/dataset-lite-augumented`

- Raw Dataset
  - You can also find the raw data from the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13_szSJ_DuF98blFr58l8hNftC2lXeWy1/view?usp=drive_link)

### Prerequisites

- Jupyter Notebook

  - Install the classic Jupyter Notebook with:

    ```sh
    pip install notebook
    ```

  - To run the notebook:

    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

- PyTorch

  - Install PyTorch with:

    ```sh
    pip install torch torchvision
    ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ChengaFEI/cnn-driven-architecture-style-classifier.git
   ```

2. Create a [virtual environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment)

3. Install the [IPython kernel](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html)

4. Run the notebook

   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

The notebook is self-explanatory. You can run the cells one by one to see the results.
